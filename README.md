Documenting All Sources, Helped Received (if any) and Design Choices.


The project is organized in two separate directories, Interfaces and Sources...

    How to compile & run:
        javac -d . Proj2.java
        java Proj2




    How it works:
User will be asked to provide the number of virtual player(s)
It shall run the Table with the appropiate amount of virtualized players.
The Virtual Players follow a basic algorithm:
* Pick up a card from either deck or stack
* Lay down a card in either the deck or stack

If the deck or hand is empty, it shall evaluate the hands,
winner is chosen by player who's hand is lesser in rank value than the opponent's.

    - MyStack ADT Based on:

    - JList from Javax Swing

Design Choices:
    
    - Behavioral / Observer:
    Call to Main class creates Table, which calls upon the other Classes,
    utilizes Java Utility ADTs (List) and its methods. Reflects changes cross object-wise.


    Main Class
        -> Table Class
            -> Deck , Hand , Set ( Set utilizes MyStack, 
                                Deck & Hand & Set utilizes Java ADTs
                                and javax swing and other utilities )



Help Provided to Team:
    - Helped on advising how to and what to implement certain methods to the team.
    - Provided a pseudocode / blueprint on how to manage the sorting(s) to the team.
    - Helped Nicole on how to implement Stack / MyStack to work with other classes.
    - Provided tip(s) to Orlando how to organize the sources & interfaces.

Help Provided by Team:
    - Nicole helped me understand how the buttons work / interact.
    - Nicole provided tips on polishing the Table code and interactions with virtual players.
    - Nicole gave me moral support by being cheerful.
